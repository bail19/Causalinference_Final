  * This project handles a animal shelter data set which records animals intake and outcome information in the Long Beach Animal Shelter.
  
  * Here are the reference of my data set and other information I used to explain the idea of causal inference in my project:
  
  * (2022). Animal Shelter Data [Dataset]. <i> https://data.longbeach.gov/explore/dataset/animal-shelter-intakes-and-outcomes/</i>
  
  * Manuscript of "Sensitivity to Unmeasured Confounding" on Canvas. <i> https://wakeforest.instructure.com/courses/40782/files/2429782?module_item_id=742276 </i>
